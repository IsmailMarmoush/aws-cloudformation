## aws-cloudformation project

This project discusses ways of building out an aws account from scratch using automated deployment processes.  

The idea is:

1) Clean aws account
2) Create s3 bucket
3) upload deployment cloudformation template
4) execute the template manually
5) deploy everything else through deployment pipeline.
